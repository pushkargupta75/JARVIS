# Jarvis - AI Voice Assistant

Jarvis is a Python-based AI voice assistant that performs basic system tasks and provides intelligent responses using the Gemini API. It allows users to interact with their system using voice commands and automates tasks such as opening applications, fetching information, and browsing the web.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Listens to voice commands using the `speech_recognition` module.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Responds using a TTS engine for a natural conversational experience.
- **Application Control**: Opens applications like Notepad, Chrome, and File Explorer.
- **Web Automation**: Opens websites based on user requests.
- **System Tasks**: Fetches the current time, opens the camera, and performs system operations.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Answers queries using the Gemini API.
